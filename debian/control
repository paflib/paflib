Description: library which exposes DSC Power Facilities to userspace via an API
 PAFLib is a IBM written library which exposes Power Architecture Facilities to
 userspace via an API. This includes the Data Stream Control Register Facility
 (DSCR) and the Event-Based Branching facility (EBB). Linux kernel 3.9 has
 exposed problem-state DSCR usage for ISA 2.06 (POWER7 – emulated) and ISA 2.07
 (POWER8 – in hardware). Linux 3.10 has exposed the EBB facility.
 .
 The Data Stream Control Register (DSCR for short) of POWER processors is used
 to control the degree of aggressiveness of memory prefetching for load and
 store.

 Event Based Branches (EBBs) are a feature which allows the hardware to branch
 directly to a specified user space address when certain events occur.
